# HashMap-in-Java

This is a simple implementation of a HashMap data structure in Java. It allows you to store key-value pairs and perform basic operations like `put`, `get`, and `remove`.

## Usage

You can use this HashMap by creating an instance of the `MyHashMap` class and then calling its methods.


## Implementation Details

- The HashMap uses an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list that stores key-value pairs.
- The hash code of keys is used to determine the bucket in which they are stored.
- The implementation includes methods for adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs efficiently.
